Searching for a CMS was somewhat daunting. I needed something lightweight, but highly customizable. It had to be able to create a website small enough to run on my RaspberryPi, and preferrably be open source.
Having minimal web design experience, I didn't want to learn the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, only for my site to come out subpar.

It took a while, but eventually I settled on [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

I plan on writing a guide for it while I learn how to use it correctly. As you can see, I have _some_ capability to use it after tinkering with it for a few days, but I'll have to really deep-dive if I want to make the most of it.

Some other CMS's I considered

 - [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost)
 - [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
 - [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)
