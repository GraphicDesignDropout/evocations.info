      <description>If you’re new to IT like me, you might be surprised by how much your server is targeted. I run a small home server using a Raspberry Pi. It allows SSH connections via web, and I had no idea how much traffic it could get. I got curious and checked /var/log/auth.log.
Tens of failed authorizations each second.
Most of the IP address were coming from Chinese ISPs, or DigitalOcean servers. I wonder what these bots do once they break in?</description>

      <description>On Raspbian, I was having an issue with Python3. My first instinct was to uninstall and reinstall.
Que “I can fix it”:
$ sudo apt remove python3  “Oh f#@&amp;amp;”
Turns out, Debian (And by extension Raspbian) uses Python for tons of things.
Que: Panic. A lot of it. I started mashing CTRL-C
In the end it didn’t uninstall too many things, and my terminal was still functioning, so I tried to repair the damage.</description>
